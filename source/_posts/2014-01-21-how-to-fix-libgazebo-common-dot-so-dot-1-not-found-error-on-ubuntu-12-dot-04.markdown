With ROS Groovy installed on Ubuntu 12.04, I was trying to install Gazebo simulator. I followed instructions on this page: http://gazebosim.org/wiki/1.6/install#Compile_Instructions. Following Compile Instructions, gazebo was installed in the default directory, but step 11 gave the error: 
```
$ gazebo
gazebo: error while loading shared libraries: libgazebo_common.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

From the Gazebo Answers website, I found the solution to this problem provided by *gerkey*. It seemed the original link for this ask-and-answer post was broken and only a cached paged by google could be visited. Since this post solved my problem, I copy it here for future reference:

Answer:

tl;dr:
```
sudo bash -c "echo /usr/local/lib >> /etc/ld.so.conf"
sudo ldconfig
```
First, let's understand the situation:
```
ldd `which gazebo` | grep "not found"
```
That will give you a list of the libraries that the executable needs, but that the loader can't find. Probably libgazebo\_common.so will be in that list, likely along with many other lib\_gazebo\* libraries.

If you did a default install, it went into /usr/local. By default, your system loader might be configured not to look in /usr/local/lib. To test that, add that directory to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
```
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ldd `which gazebo` | grep "not found"
```
If that gives you an empty list, then you're ready to go, in which case you run gazebo like so:
```
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH gazebo
```
or:
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
gazebo
```
But it's better not to have to remember that. So you can configure your system to look in /usr/local/lib for libraries:
```
sudo bash -c "echo /usr/local/lib >> /etc/ld.so.conf"
sudo ldconfig
```
That should work for gazebo and for anything else that you install to /usr/local.
