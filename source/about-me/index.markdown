Currently I am a PhD student in Robotics Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). I received my Master's degree from WPI in May, 2013 and formally joined in Robotics and Intelligent Vehicles Research Laboratory (RIVeR Lab) as a PhD student later in June. Before my study in the United States, I majored in Automation at North China Electric Power University and received my bachelor's degree in Junly, 2011. I'm interested in human-in-the-loop control of assistive robots and human-robot interaction. My advisor is Professor Taskin Padir.
