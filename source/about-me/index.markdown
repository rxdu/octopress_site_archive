I am a PhD student in Robotics Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). I received my Master's degree in May, 2013 and formally joined in 
Robotics and Intelligent Vehicles Research Laboratory (RIVeR Lab) later in June. I'm interested in the control and navigation of mobile robots and my advisor is Professor Taskin Padir.
