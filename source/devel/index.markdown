I put most of my project source code on Github and Bitbucket. Some of the projects are my hobby projects and some are created for learning. I put a few of them here. I want to maintain a log for the ongoing hobby projects and keep a reference for those I feel useful for learning a specific topic.

* [Building a Quadcopter](/devel/quadcopter) - ongoing
* [Operating Systems Course Project](/devel/myos) - closed
