I put most of my project source code on Github and Bitbucket. Some of the projects are my hobby projects and some are created for learning. I put a few of them here. I want to maintain a log for the ongoing hobby projects and keep a reference for those I feel useful for learning a specific topic.

* [Building a Quadcopter](#QUAD) 
* [Operating Systems Course Project](#OS)

## Operating Systems Course Project

* My [Bitbucket Repository](https://rdu@bitbucket.org/rdu/cs502_os_project.git)
* The course website by Prof. Jerry Breecher: [CS502](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jb/CS502/)

This is the repository for my OS course project. I used C to develop a kernel for a simulated machine called Z502. Basic process management, memory management, message sending/receiving and disk/timer management were implemented.
