## Building a Quadcopter

Quadcopters have been very popular in recently a few years. Hobbyists use quadcopters to do various of interesting things such as aerial filming and FPV flight. Research organizations use them a lot as mobile platforms to do research in control, navigation, mapping etc. A quadcopter has a relative simple mechanical structure and doesn't require expensive sensors, processors and other electronic parts. But stabilization of it involves sensor fusion, automatic control and a lot of other theoretical knowledge. Thus building a quadcopter can be a ideal project for people who have learned some theories in dynamic control and want to put them into practice. One can experience how to build a flying robot from scratch and gain both theoretical and practical experience as well as tons of fun.
