I am a PhD student in Robotics Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute ([WPI](http://www.wpi.edu/)). I received my Master's degree from WPI in May, 2013 and joined in Robotics and Intelligent Vehicles Research Laboratory ([RIVeR Lab](http://robot.wpi.edu)) as a PhD student later in June. My advisor is Professor [Taskin Padir](http://tpadir.weebly.com/). I'm interested in robotics, real-time and embedded systems. My research focus is the control and navigation of mobile robots in cluttered environments. I'm also an active member of [Team WPI-CMU](http://robot.wpi.edu/drc/) for the [DARPA Robotics Challenge](http://www.theroboticschallenge.org/).
