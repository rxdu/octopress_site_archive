I am a PhD student in Robotics Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). I received my Master's degree in May, 2013 and formally joined in 
Robotics and Intelligent Vehicles Research Laboratory ([RIVeR Lab](http://robot.wpi.edu)) later in June. I'm interested in the control and navigation of mobile robots and my advisor is Professor Taskin Padir.
