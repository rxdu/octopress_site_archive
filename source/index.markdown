Currently I am a PhD student in Robotics Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). I received my Master's degree from WPI in May, 2013 and formally joined in Robotics and Intelligent Vehicles Research Laboratory ([RIVeR Lab](http://robot.wpi.edu)) as a PhD student later in June. I'm interested in the perception, control and navigation of mobile robots and my advisor is Professor [Taskin Padir](http://tpadir.weebly.com/).
