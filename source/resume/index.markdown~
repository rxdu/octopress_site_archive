## EDUCATION

* **Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), Worcester, MA USA**
	- Doctor of Philosophy in Robotics Engineering, GPA: 3.89 - 08/2013 to Present
	- Master of Science in Robotics Engineering, GPA: 3.83/4 - 06/2013
* **North China Electric Power University (NCEPU), China**
	- Bachelor of Engineering in Automation, GPA: 87.9/100 - 07/2011

<a name="SKILLS"></a>
## TECHNICAL SKILLS

* **Software**: Matlab, Eclipse, Git
* **Programming**: C/C++, Robot Operating System (ROS), OpenCV, PCL, wxWidgets, Qt
* **Microcontroller**: Freescale S12/S12X, AVR, STM32F, ARM7

I'm familiar with development in both Windows and Linux. A lot of my project development work is done in Ubuntu with C++ and ROS. I'm comfortable with using open-source tools to do embedded development, such as Eclipse and GNU Toolschains. I use Git a lot to manage both my personal projects and projects collaborating with others.
